Here we will examine the expansion of Rio Rancho using Landsat imagery from 1990-2010.

# Rio Rancho expansion

The city of Rio Rancho is the 3rd largest city in the state of New Mexico with [a population of ~100,000](https://archive.ph/20200213114736/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/GCTPH1.ST10/0400000US01). Located just outside Albuquerque, Rio Rancho is home to sprawling suburbs and commercial areas.

Rio rancho has grown relatively rapidly, causing Sandoval County to be [the fastest-growing county](https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/sandoval-rises-as-new-mexico-s-fastest-growing-county/article_301443b9-7b15-565d-99d1-e7bac757c829.html) in New Mexico in recent years, with [further expansion anticipated in the near future](https://newmexiconewsport.com/citizens-want-rio-rancho-to-be-commercialized/).

## Rio Rancho Estates

However, Rio Rancho is also home to an enormous real-estate scam called "Rio Rancho Estates", barren area of ~46,000 acres. The development is currently just desert with a few dirt roads cut with no other improvement. These can be clearly seen in images of the city. 

The sellers, AMREP Corporation, gave naive buyers free dinners and "a variety of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises" to coerce them to buy. In 1977, four of AMREPâ€™s executives were convicted of mail and land fraud for misleading buyers about Rio Rancho Estates.
